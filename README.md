Theme
------
    I chose to do a **"In Space..."** theme based on the movie quote **"In Space... No 
one can hear you scream."**

Search Methodology
------
    For the images I tried to search for the **"In Space..."** line but it only came
up with random unrelated images.  I ended up settling for a standard background
image of space.  
    For the twitter quotes the **"In Space..."** line actually worked quite well so 
I went with that.

Known Problems
------
    A pretty obvious problem with the page is the quote not being centered to the
page.  I tried multiple avenues to get the quote div to center but it would not 
cooperate.
    Another problem is the pages general ugliness.

Improvements
------
    If I had more time to work on the page I would probably try to incorporate 
bootstrap or some other framework that would make the page more appealing.  Also,
I would get the quotes to display in a better font and have it centered on the page.
